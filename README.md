Depict
======

Status of the project
---------------------

Not yet useful in any way.

Description
-----------

> /dɪˈpɪkt/: to represent or show something in a picture or story

Depict has two components:

* A python module to model the structure and behavior of a program based on the program's source code and data gathered during the program execution.

* An HTML application to display a graphical representation of that model.

See some [alternatives](https://github.com/qdamian/depict#alternatives) below.

Like disptrace, Depict uses HTML5 as the prefered type of output format, and provides collapse/expand capabilities to choose which part of the repesentation is displayed.

Like pyreverse, Depict allows to limit the scope of the representation to a part of the program, e.g. a group of classes.

Alternatives
------------

[pyreverse][pyreverse] is a Python Reverse engineering tool. It's able to generate UML like diagram from Python source code.

[disptrace][disptrace] is a great project that traces a program and creates an HTML5 document displaying called functions.

[andypatterns][andypatterns] A reverse engineering tool for Python source code. Requires wxPython

For JS, [violin] looks interesting.
